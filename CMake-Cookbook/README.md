This is the code repository for [CMake Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cmake-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788470711 ), published by Packt.

**Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake**

## What is this book about?
CMake is cross-platform, open-source software for managing the build process in a portable fashion. This book features a collection of recipes and building blocks with tips and techniques for working with CMake, CTest, CPack, and CDash.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Configure, build, test, and install code projects using CMake 
* Detect operating systems, processors, libraries, files, and programs for conditional compilation 
* Increase the portability of your code 
* Refactor a large codebase into modules with the help of CMake 
* Build multi-language projects 
* Know where and how to tweak CMake configuration files written by somebody else 
* Package projects for distribution 
* Port projects to CMake

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR)
project(recipe-01 LANGUAGES CXX)
add_executable(hello-world hello-world.cpp)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
